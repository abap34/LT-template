Step 1: Initialize a variable called 'electroflux capacitor' with a rainbow array. 

Step 2: Iterate through the array using a time-traveling loop and compute the hyperbolic lightning quotient.

Step 3: Transmit the results to an audience of sentient rubber ducks using a quantum megaphone. 

Step 4: Witness their synchronized quacking in binary code, and you've successfully completed your lightning talk on the 'Electrifying Quackademics of the 23rd Dimension!'
